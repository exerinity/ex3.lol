        <h1>Projects</h1>
        <p>I've been active on the internet since 2014, but mostly since 2019. During that time, I've made some random things, mostly Discord bots.
           This page covers my current and past projects.</p>
        <hr>
        <h1>Current</h1>
        <h3>ex3</h3>
        <p>A basic Discord utility bot with no set category of functionality.</p>
        <a href="invite">Invite</a>
        <br>
        <h3>pigeon</h3>
        <p>An even more basic AI chatbot designed to occupy an entire channel. Supports remembering up to 100 messages, history exporting, and no cross-server memory.</p>
        <a href="pigeon">Website</a> <a href="pigeon-invite">Invite</a>
        <h3>This Website</h3>
        <p>y</p>
        <a href="/">Home</a>
        <hr>
        <h1>Defunct</h1>
        <footer>All of these were made under <a href="https://sparkfire298.com">sparkfire298</a>. Every project under that name is defunct. So is the website.</footer>
        <h3>sparkmusic</h3>
        <p>An advanced music bot supporting pretty much every site on the internet. Started May 2023, shut down May 2024.<br>
        It started off being able to search from incompetech.com, Kevin MacLeod's music. I was pretty happy with that, as I never saw another bot do this. It eventually grew to over 1000 sites being supported.</p>
        <h3>sparkbot</h3>
        <p>Text-based command version of ex3, basically. Dates unknown, as I often started new builds at random times and shut them down.</p>
        <h3>sparkfirebot</h3>
        <p>My debut bot, it had over 200 commands. I started it in 2020 and shut it down June 2022, due to the difficulty of maintaining such a large bot. It also used discord.js v12, which had many problems in 2022.</p>
        <h3>Modango</h3>
        <p>A moderation-utility bot that was fairly simple and easy to maintain. I stopped working on it in January, but kept it online until August, "frozen in time". The name was a portmanteau of "moderation" and "mango". I started it some time in 2022, after closing sparkfirebot.</p>
        <h3>sparkfire298.xyz</h3>
        <p>A website with tools, and other random things.</p>
        <h3>Days left Mastodon bot</h3>
        <p>A mastodon bot that posted how many days were left of the year, every day. It was extremely simple and light, using not even 2 MB of RAM. It only lasted until the end of 2023, and never saw 2024.</p>
        <h3>hastebot</h3>
        <p>A bot with the entire point of posting to hastebin. Finding it entirely useless and actually more complicated, it didn't even last 3 months. Made in 2022. Furthermore, Toptal changing everything about hastebin just poured more fuel onto the fire.</p>
