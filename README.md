# License  
This is probably the wrong license - but:

CC BY-SA-NC 4.0. This means:

## You can
- Share the code
- Modify the code non-commercially
### Under the condition that:  
- You attribute me
- Anything you make is the same license

## You cannot:
- Use this commercially

(I don't do any of my stuff commercially, it's all a hobby I do to kill time; and I don't make money from it)
- Apply legal terms or technical restrictions

### BUT:
There might be third-party copyrighted content on this site. This is obviously not under CC-BY-SA-NC 4.0. In that case, if the owner of said content wants it gone, [email me](https://ex3.lol/email).
